<h1>Blowing Up On TikTok</h1>

<p>
- Post videos that you want to go most viral first thing on a Saturday morning

- Use four hashtags related to your post (you can use #fyp but then you can only have 3 other hashtags)

- Say something in the first 3 seconds of the video to grab attention

- Keep people watching the video by leaving them with a mystery factor every time you show a new screen (explain what you are doing to draw attention then say something but leave out a part of it to keep that attention)

- Give the people a reason to follow your account and/or like the video

- Wait 30 seconds before commenting anything to tell people anything extra

- Do NOT like your own post

- Do NOT ask people to interact with the video, let them do it themselves.

- Tell people to follow JUST at the end
